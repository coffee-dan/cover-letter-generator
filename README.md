# cover-letter-generator
> Cover letter template toolkit

## Usage
Access [live demo](https://coffee-dan.github.io/cover-letter-generator/), 
fill out cover letter form using placeholder [like this] then hit `Next Step`, specify replacements for those placeholders then hit `Generator Cover Letter`,
review your letter then hit `Cover Letter File` to download a Markdown copy of your cover letter or go back to the previous two steps.

## Thought process
I wanted a simple lean tool for writing many many cover letters with few mistakes. And I wanted a project to test out TypeScript with, thus cover-letter-generator
