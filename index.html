					During my previous role at [previous_employer], I built a website completely from scratch for a rcently rebranded business, both ahead of schedule and within budget. I started by gathering requirements from my clients and holding a focus group to perform user research. My favorite part about web design is building a solution that impresses the client and meets the needs of users and cusomters. My new website was responsive, extremely fast, and included the latest e-commerce features. After launch, I reduced the bounce rate on the website's landing page by 35%. As your [position_name], I would bring these skills to develop websites that exceed the expectations of clients and customers, and drive real business results.
